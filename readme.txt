The Order Approval for WCFM plugin enables vendors to review and either accept or reject customer orders before any payment is made.

== Description ==

The Order Approval for WCFM plugin allows vendors to review and either accept or reject customer orders before processing any payments. This feature is made possible by combining the WCFM plugin with the SG Order Approval for woocommerce plugin. With this plugin, you can easily manage orders from multiple vendors while ensuring that payments are not collected from customers until the orders are approved by the vendors.


The benefits of using the Order Approval feature for the WCFM plugin are:

* Improved order management: With this feature, vendors have greater control over the orders they receive and can choose to accept or reject them based on their availability or other factors.

* Increased customer satisfaction: By allowing vendors to review orders before payment is processed, customers can be assured that their orders will be fulfilled by the vendor of their choice, which can lead to greater satisfaction and repeat business.

* Reduced payment issues: The Order Approval feature ensures that payment is not collected from customers until their orders have been approved by the vendors. This helps to reduce payment-related issues that may arise from canceled orders or delayed shipments.

Overall, the Order Approval feature can help to streamline the order management process for vendors and improve the customer experience, leading to greater success for the multi-vendor marketplace.
